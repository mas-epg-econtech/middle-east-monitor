"""
Friendly names and brief plain-language descriptions for time-series.

Used by the renderer to:
  - Replace long technical legend labels with shorter friendly names
    (e.g., "Jet Fuel NWE FOB Barges" → "NWE FOB Barges").
  - Promote the friendly name into the chart title for single-series charts
    (e.g., "Jet Fuel — NWE FOB Barges" instead of "Jet Fuel — USD/metric tonne").
  - Replace the generic node description with a series-specific one explaining
    what's actually being plotted in plain language.

Lookup strategy: `lookup(series_id, series_name)` tries series_id first (most
stable for short IDs), then series_name (fallback for series whose IDs are
truncated to 64 chars in the DB but whose names are intact). A handful of
entries are keyed by series_id — notably the Motorist scraped pump prices,
whose series_name rotates depending on which station was scraped last.

Editorial style: keep descriptions to one sentence, accessible to a reader who
isn't a commodity-markets specialist. Mention geography + product + market role.
