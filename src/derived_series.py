Derived series — values computed from other tables in the DB rather than
fetched from an external source.

Currently:
  - mas_core_inflation_mom : derived from ceic_mas_core_inflation_index
    (the level index 2024=100). MAS doesn't publish a Core Inflation MoM
    series directly — only the level and the YoY — so we compute the
    month-on-month percentage change ourselves: (level_t / level_{t-1} - 1) × 100.

  - singstat_chem_export_<iso2> : per-country time series of SG chemical
    exports to that country, projected from trade_singstat onto time_series
    so the existing chart_grid renderer can consume it without needing a
    new section type. One series per regional country (CN, IN, ID, JP, MY,
    PH, KR, TW, TH, VN). See compute_singstat_chem_export_country_series().

    as published. Rebasing to a common 2025=100 puts them on the same
    scale and aligns visually with Singapore Sectoral IPI ("Index 2025=100").

    For each country:
      1. Try `regional_ipi_level_<iso2>` (fetched from CEIC).
      2. If that's missing OR has no 2025 data, fall back to chain-
         reconstruction from `regional_ipi_<iso2>` (YoY %). Used for
         China specifically — NBS publishes VAI as YoY only, no
         continuous level index exists.
      3. Rebase: divide by the country's 2025 monthly average × 100.

    Output series:
      `regional_ipi_index_<iso2>`  Monthly, unit "Index (2025=100)"

    Reconstruction method (when falling back):
      Anchor: first 12 months of YoY data set to level=100 each.
      Chain: level_t = level_{t-12} × (1 + YoY_t/100) for t after anchor.
      Rebase: as above.
    The within-year seasonal pattern starts flat in the anchor year
    and builds as YoY values diverge — by 2021+ (the dashboard window)
    the recent pattern is reasonably faithful.

    """Project the Singapore + Malacca subset of the shipping nowcast JSON
    into the time_series table.

    IMPORTANT data-shape note: PortWatch publishes 3 distinct stats per
    (port × day × vessel type):
      - calls           — single de-duped vessel arrival count (no direction)
      - imports_tonnage — cargo weight unloaded (inbound)
      - exports_tonnage — cargo weight loaded (outbound)
    The upstream JSON helpfully duplicates the `_calls` count under both
    `_imports_calls` and `_exports_calls` keys (they're literally identical).
    We follow the original shipping-nowcast dashboard's convention and use
    the EXPORTS key as the canonical un-duplicated source for calls.

    Tanker tonnage naming quirk: the upstream nowcast pipeline emits
    tanker tonnage under the *un-suffixed* key `singapore_<dir>_tonnage`
    (NOT `singapore_<dir>_tanker_tonnage`). See nowcast_pipeline.py:1826
    where `label_suffix = "_tonnage" if vt_key == "tanker"` short-circuits
    the otherwise-uniform `_<vt>_tonnage` pattern. Verified by cross-check
    against raw CSV: weekly-mean(daily-sum(import_tanker)) × 7 ≈ raw
    sum(import_tanker) for SG, so this key really is tanker-specific
    despite the misleading name. Documented in REGIONAL_TRADE_NOTES.md.

    Geographic coverage: country-level — aggregated across all 3 SG
    PortWatch ports (Singapore main, Serangoon Harbor, Singapore -
    Offshore Oil Terminal 1) via `groupby("date").agg(sum)` in
    `_run_aggregate_port_group` upstream.
